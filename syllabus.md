# Integral Representations

1. The integral from \(0\) to \(2x\) with the integrand \(f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)\) with respect to \(d\theta\):

   $$ 
   \int_{0}^{2x} f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) \, d\theta 
   $$

2. The integral from \(-\infty\) to \(\infty\) with the integrand \(f(x)\) with respect to \(dx\):

   $$ 
   \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx 
   $$
